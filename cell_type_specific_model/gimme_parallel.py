    """
    Parallelized implementation of the GIMME algorithm across multiple expression samples.

    This function performs the following steps:
      1. Saves the original reaction order.
      2. Uses the provided list of exchange reaction IDs.
      3. Counts how many of these exchange reactions are reversible.
      4. Sets up objective reactions for biomass and ATPase.
      5. Runs FBA for these objectives and updates their lower bounds (20% of max flux).
      6. Updates irreversible exchange reactions using FVA and then splits reversible exchange reactions.
      7. Extracts necessary model parameters (stoichiometric matrix, bounds, reaction and metabolite IDs).
      8. Optionally writes a validated SBML for workers to load; falls back to deep copies if SBML invalid.
      9. Runs GIMME in parallel and aggregates the recombined results.

    Parameters:
        model (cobra.Model): The metabolic model.
        expressionRxns (np.array): Expression data matrix (reactions x samples).
        exchange_reactions (list): List of exchange reaction IDs.
        num_workers (int): Number of parallel workers (default 2).
        force_recompute (bool): If True, recompute even if cached results exist (default False).
