      1. Saves the original reaction order.
      2. Uses the provided list of exchange reaction IDs.
      3. Counts how many of these exchange reactions are reversible.
      4. Sets up objective reactions for biomass and ATPase.
      5. Runs FBA to determine maximum fluxes for these objective reactions and updates their lower bounds (20% of max flux).
      6. Updates irreversible exchange reactions using FVA and then splits reversible exchange reactions 
         (using FVA results) so that they can be handled as two separate (forward and reverse) reactions.
      7. Extracts necessary model parameters (e.g., stoichiometric matrix, bounds, reaction and metabolite IDs).
      8. Runs the GIMME algorithm in parallel on each expression sample using a ProcessPoolExecutor.
      9. Aggregates the flux solutions from all samples and saves them to a CSV file.
      10. Resets the model's objective to its original state.
