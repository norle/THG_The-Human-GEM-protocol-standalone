    Expect that the stoichiometry is consistent.

    Stoichiometric inconsistency violates universal constraints:
    1. Molecular masses are always positive, and
    2. On each side of a reaction the mass is conserved.
    A single incorrectly defined reaction can lead to stoichiometric
    inconsistency in the model, and consequently to unconserved metabolites.
    Similar to insufficient constraints, this may give rise to cycles which
    either produce mass from nothing or consume mass from the model.
