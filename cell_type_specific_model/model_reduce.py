'''
Analyzes metabolic reaction activity across samples, tailors the model by removing low-activity reactions, and restores functionality through gap-filling.

Inputs (set by default)
----------
    solutions_mat (str): Path to .mat file with flux solutions matrix, where rows are reactions and columns are samples with flux values.
    sbml_model (str): Path to GEM SBML model file.
    reaction_id_biomass (str): ID of the biomass reaction to check its presence across samples.
    tolerance (float): Tolerance level for gap-filling (e.g., 0.001), defining the lower bound for reaction activity.

Outputs
----------
    model_tailored.xml: SBML file for tailored model excluding zero-activity reactions.
    model_after_gapfilling.xml: SBML file for tailored model after gap-filling.
    compartments_info.txt: Text file with reaction presence and blocked reaction data by compartment.

Description
----------
    1. Loads flux data from iMAT, discretizes fluxes, and computes mean presence of each reaction across samples.
    2. Groups reactions by presence levels and identifies consistently absent or present reactions.
    3. Identifies blocked reactions in the model by compartment and organizes reactions by presence group within compartments.
    4. Creates a tailored model without absent reactions and saves it.
    5. Removes genes and metabolites not associated with any reaction in the tailored model.
    6. Performs gap-filling to ensure functionality in the tailored model, saving the gap-filled version for further analysis.
